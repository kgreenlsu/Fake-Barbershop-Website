# Fake-Barbershop-Website
The barbershop website was a test of my ability to make a website for a small business. The website is based on a real barbershop in North Philadelphia that I have gone to since I was 7 years old. I had never really put in any thought as to if the barbershop had a website or not. One day I was sitting in the chair getting my hair cut and I was thinking of what my next project was going to be and then it came to me that I could make a barbershop website. The barbershop that I made is something that I am proud of because just like the La Salle University website it is something that has been a part of my life for a while.
